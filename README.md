This repo takes care of dotfiles in the same way that is shown here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

Dotfiles stay in their original directories, so no symlinks are needed. 

To install easily, just run this command:

curl -Lks https://gist.github.com/ggadget6/991e6510a24c181c952a7dedb7c6d0b4/raw/ | /bin/bash
